# Express MongoDB Auth Demos

These demonstrations expand on those in the lecture content for a web security course lecture that I teach at SAIT. Much of the code comes from there. However I've made the following adjustments

- Demonstrate use with Mongo Atlas (including some debugging tips)
- Use Async/Await syntax
- Modularisation
- Error Handling

My goal is to explore and show different ways this code can be used.
